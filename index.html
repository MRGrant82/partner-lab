        <h3>about me:</h3>
        <p class="myP">Hello, my name is Juan Olmedo I currently reside the state of Washington. I'm currenlty going through 
            a MedBoard process to get out of the Army. I used to be in the Airforce but decided to go to the Army (don't ask).
            I have a bachleor's in Business and a Masters in Systems Engineering I have taken my Sec+. The jobs I have 
            held are Avionics Mechanic, Quality Assurance, Quality Engineer, and Software Development Analyst for many
            companies. My latest job as an analyst has shown me many aspects of software development and the cloud 
            which I enjoy. One of my goals is to move on to the cloud team at Northrop Grumman so I can either 
            develop on the cloud or conduct IT services for the cloud. 
        </p>
